# Voice-to-Text-to-3D Pipeline for Unity-based VR Applications

## Overview
A novel voice-to-text-to-3D pipeline for Unity-based VR applications using C# and Python. This involves the seamless integration of voice recognition technology and natural language processing to understand and translate user commands into 3D object creation in the VR environment. The pipeline uses a cutting-edge 3D object generative model, enabling users to generate and interact with 3D objects using only their voice, providing a more immersive and intuitive VR experience.
